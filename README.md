# Windows Fixes

This is a repository of my curated fixes for Windows 10/11. 

These fixes aren't guaranteed to work. 

Using these files will modify your system. I take no responsibility for issues caused by your usage of them.

No support will be given as these are primarily for my personal use.

I will add some proper documentation at some point, but the file names are mostly self-explanatory.

Currently broken: 
- disable_group-by_downloads.reg
- RemoveAMDContextMenus.reg
- Run As Administrator PS (should work on Win10)

Windows 10 only:
- Remove3DObjectsFolder.reg

Windows 11 only:
- Context Menu
- Remove Gallery
- DisableStartSearch.reg
- UninstallWidgets.ps1
